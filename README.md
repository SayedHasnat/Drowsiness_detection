# Drowsiness_detection_using_matlab
 I have tried to detect drowsiness via matlab image processing tools. This is primary. Files will be changed if there is any update. I had used those code and simply it was well but its not generalised yet. If it doesn't give you the exact decision, then you can change the range of 'n' in the code
